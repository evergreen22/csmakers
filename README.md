# CS Makers - Professional Development Web Site

 Welcome to the CS Makers git repository for the CS Makers lessons and materials web site. The [CS Makers web site](https://cs.csis.work/csmakers/) is a repository of computer science lessons and resources from the [NSF INCLUDES CS Makers grant](https://csmakers.org) and ALSDE CS Makers Teacher PDs. The CS Makers curriculum is aligned with the [Alabama course of study on Digital Literacy and Computer Science](https://www.alabamaachieves.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Final-2018-Digital-Literacy-and-Computer-Science-COS-5-14-19.pdf). The lesson sets on the web site include computer science materials for teachers and students with making activities that incorporate the BBC micro:bit.
